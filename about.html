   <p>I am an upcoming Full Stack Web Developer currently training as a Pursuit Fellow. <br>My current goal is to become a developer for a video game company and help create incredible gameplay as well as create new, relatable and diverse stories for those in marginalized communities, <br>such as the LGBTQ+ community, women, women of color, disabled people, and so many others who don't have much representation in the gaming industry. <br>

    My extensive knowledge regarding video games and my life experience as an Afro-Latina woman who's a part of the LGBTQ+ community in the gaming industry <br> makes it easy for me to see what is lacking in said industry, and that is what I intend to focus on once I have garnered the skills from my training at Pursuit.</p>
